Managing notifications
======================

From the Notifications tab, authenticated and logged in users have the possibility to manage which domain-related notifications and OpenDataSoft-related newsletters they wish to receive by email.


Notifications are sent by email to your portal's users depending on their permissions. They are always sent by the support@opendatasoft.com address.

   If you'd like notifications to be sent from a different sender address, for example an address of your own organization, please contact the support team.


Subscribing to alerts and reports
---------------------------------

Whenever an important event occurs on your portal, notification emails are sent. This gives you the opportunity to be informed in real time and take action if needed.



3 types of domain-related notifications can be sent:

- Daily reports
- Processing alerts
- Quota alerts



Subscribing to OpenDataSoft newsletters
---------------------------------------

2 types of newsletters can be sent:

- Product News: informs about new features, shares tips and tricks about the OpenDataSoft platform
- Data Ecosystem News: informs about the data world (articles, events, featured datasets etc.)

Tick the box corresponding to any of the newsletters to subscribe. Untick any of the boxes to stop receiving the corresponding newsletter.
