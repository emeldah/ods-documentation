Sharing and reusing data
========================

As a user of open data, you may come accross some datasets that you will be particularly interested in. You may also want to contribute to the open data environment. Multiple options are available, depending on what kind of user you are, or what you wish to achieve.

This section of the documentation will focus on:

- Reuses, to either discover the data-based creations of others, or to submit your very own creations.
- Sharing your favorite visualizations, or embedding them in any kind of HTML page or website.
- Exporting data that your want to keep, in various formats.
- Using APIs to go even further with data.
