Getting involved: sharing, reusing & reacting
=============================================

As a user of open data, multiple options are available to get more involved into the open data environment. Whether come accross some datasets that you are particularly interested in, and want to share them with the world. Or whether you have specific skills you believe could be put to use to create something with those published data.

This section of the documentation will focus on each available option to share, reuse & react:

- Reuses, to either discover the data-based creations of others, or to submit your very own creations.
- Sharing your favorite visualizations, or embedding them in any kind of HTML page or website.

- Using APIs to go even further with data.
- Commenting and discussing with other users about datasets.

- Using social networks to share favorite dataset visualizations.
- Submitting feedbacks to help portal administrators improve their data.
