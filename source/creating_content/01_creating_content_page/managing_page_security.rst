Managing the security of a page
===============================

Content pages created with the OpenDataSoft platform can either be accessible by anyone allowed on the portal, or restricted to specifically defined users.

To manage a content page security, go to the Pages section of the back office, in the Security tab of the chosen content page.

Choosing an access policy
-------------------------

To choose the access policy of a content page:

1. Go to Security > Access policy.
2. Click

   a. either, the "Public access" button, to let any user access the page, as long as they have access to the portal,
   b. or, the "Private access" button, to restrict the access to the page to specically defined users and/or groups of users.

   If a user has access to a content page but which was created with datasets that user isn't allowed to access, all related visualizations will not load. However, the user will be able to read all other information displayed on the content page, such as text.

Managing access to a private page
---------------------------------

Private content pages are meant to be only visible by defined users and/or groups of users, which can be granted specific permissions.
