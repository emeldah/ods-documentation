"Standard views allow your users to dive further into your datasets, but they"
" are tools. They do not provide additional context and do not highlight what"
" you think are the key facts to take away. And while the *description* "

"The custom view is an additional tab that lives alongside the other tabs on "

"HTML and CSS editor enables you to write a dashboard as simple or as complex"
" as you may want (for more information about writing beautiful dashboard, "
"see the :doc:`dedicated documentation </creating_content/index>`) and you "
"can even customize the title and icon of this additional tab."

"Icons are taken from the `Font awesome 4.7 icon set "
