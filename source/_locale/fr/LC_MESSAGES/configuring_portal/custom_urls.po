"As the domain URL is a very important tool for discoverability, branding and"

"These customization options are currently not exposed in the back office, "

"It is possible to add additional OpenDataSoft domain aliases that will be "

"where ``alias`` is a word composed of lowercase alphanumeric characters and "
"hyphens. Some names are reserved and not available as domain names or "
"aliases. Ambiguous names should be avoided in order to prevent possible "

"A trailing dot after after a DNS name means an absolute name, instead of a "

"Any number of distinct DNS names can be added to an OpenDataSoft domain. "
"Though all domain names and aliases can be used to access the domain "
"simultaneously, the first alias will be used by default for URLs generated "
"to access the site from outside (in a notification email for example). User "

"HTTPS is a widely used protocol which aims at ensuring privacy and integrity"
" of the exchanges between a website and its users by providing HTTP over a "
"secure communication layer. For these safety and integrity reasons, the "
"OpenDataSoft platform enforces the use of HTTPS throughout its services, and"
" as such, requests made to OpenDataSoft domains and all their aliases are "
"HTTPS enabled. TLS is the actual protocol used to secure HTTPS today, which "
"replaced the original, deprecated, SSL protocol."

"If one chose to add an OpenDataSoft alias to the domain "
"(``<alias>.opendatasoft.com``), the TLS configuration is the same as for the"
" main name. However, if one chose to use a custom domain name "
"(``data.example.com``), the TLS certificate will be generated by "
"OpenDataSoft on one's behalf using `Let's Encrypt "
"<https://letsencrypt.org/>`_'s services. Certificate generation and renewal "
"is handled by OpenDataSoft transparently, and the renewal process is "
"completely automated, as long as the DNS entry is setup and stays valid. "
"Let's Encrypt certificates provide the same level of security as any other "
"Domain-Validated TLS certificates, and their short lifecycle (3 months) "
"ensures a constantly updated security level. Let's Encrypt certificates are "
"free of charge for OpenDataSoft customers."
