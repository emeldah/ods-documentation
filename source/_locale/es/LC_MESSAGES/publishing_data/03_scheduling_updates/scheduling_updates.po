"The OpenDataSoft platform makes it possible, in the very same data catalog, "
"to handle completely static datasets (which need to be published only once) "
"and live datasets (which need to be regularly updated). Two different "
"mechanisms are made available to handle datasets refresh."

"The first one is called **scheduling** and consists in having a dataset "
"being automatically republished at fixed intervals. This mode is most useful"
" for datasets with a remote resource which is regularly updated."

"The second one consists in pushing data on the OpenDataSoft platform using a"
" dedicated API end point. This mode is most useful when the data can be sent"
" directly by the system that produces the data points, such as a computer "
"program sending event metrics or a set of sensors sending their readings."

"For some types of data, it can be useful to push data instead of the more "
"traditional model of having the data being pulled from a resource by the "
"platform. To address this need, the OpenDataSoft platform offers a realtime "
"push API. It is not to be confused with the ability to schedule a dataset "
"processing. When scheduling, the dataset will periodically pull the resource"
" and process the data that is inside of it, whereas with the push API, the "
"dataset is fed by an application through a push API and records are "
"processed one by one as soon as they are received."

"Sometimes it is useful to update the existing records instead of just "

"number of copies available for each books in a public library. Suppose that "
"we have such a dataset with two fields: ``isbn``, representing the `ISBN "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number>`_ number "
"of the book, and ``number_of_copies`` tracking the current number of copies "
"available in the library. It would not make a lot of sense to add one record"

"set the new ``number_of_copies`` value to the record corresponding to the "
"book ``isbn``."

"In order to set up such a system with the OpenDataSoft platform, the fields "

"individual books, and these books are identified by the ISBN. This can be "
"done in the processing view, in the menu that pops when the configuration "
"button is pressed. It is possible to set multiple fields as unique keys. "
"Then, after saving and publishing, if a new record whose key value is equal "
"to an existing record is pushed, the new record will overwrite the old "
"record. In our library case, if your dataset has ``isbn`` as the unique key,"
