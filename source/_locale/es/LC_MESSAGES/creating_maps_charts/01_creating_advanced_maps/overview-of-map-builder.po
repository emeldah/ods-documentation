"Map Builder is a tool to create maps. Map Builder’s maps are more advanced "
"than those simply created within the Map tab of a published dataset because "
"you can overlay as many datasets as you want in the same map, creating "
"different data layers. This specificity thus makes these maps great for "
"enriching your data by crossing them together. You can also group your "
"layers and edit their descriptions and titles in order to obtain and share a"
" map finely designed to meet specific needs and purposes."
