"An *Application Programming Interface*, or API for short, is an interface "
"designed to let programs exchange data. OpenDataSoft's API provide an "
"unified way of accessing any data that were pushed to the platform, "

"defined by the data owner."

"The whole OpenDataSoft platform relies exclusively on these very APIs to "

"presentation layer for the data provided by the APIs."

"All APIs will provide you access to the same data, only in different ways. "

"Everything within the platform is related through a tree structure. Which "

"Here is the main differences and key changes between API v1 and API v2."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:57
msgid ""
"APIv2 introduces a better implementation of REST principles. Each API entry-"
"point provides links to easily navigate between linked resources (HATEOAS)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:59
msgid ""
"This API proposes a more complete query language with new functions and "
"arithmetic expressions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:60
msgid ""
"Special filters (geofilter or facet filters) are moved to the query language"
" instead. For instance ``geofilter.distance='42,1,100'`` is replaced by "
"``q=distance(geo_field,geom'Point(42 1)',100)``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:62
msgid ""
"Aggregation API (former analyze API) comes with a new ``SQL`` like language "
"and is available on catalog in addition to dataset records."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:64
msgid ""
"Exporters have their own entry-point under ``/api/catalog/exports`` and "
"``/api/catalog/datasets/<dataset_id>/exports``"

"Navigation search (former facet search) and standard search are completely "

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:71
msgid ""
"These 3 acronyms refer to other standards that the platform implements. If "
"you are not familiar with these standards, then you should stick with the "
"ODS API since it provides the most comprehensive access to the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:75
msgid "ODATA"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:77
msgid ""
"ODATA is a standard for REST APIs that provide a common language to be used "
"across APIs to perform requests. The trade-off for this norm's generic "
"approach is its higher complexity compared to traditional custom REST APIs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/using_api/index.rst:80
msgid ""
"OpenDataSoft implements this norm for the simple operations (searching for "
"datasets and records) but the more complex ones (such as analysis, "
"aggregations, geographic computations...) are only available through our V1 "
"and V2 APIs."
