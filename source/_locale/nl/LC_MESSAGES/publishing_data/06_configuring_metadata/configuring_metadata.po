"Metadata can be seen as the data describing the dataset itself. They are "
"indeed a set of fields that once filled up, describe the dataset and the "
"data it contains. Filling up the metadata of a dataset is really important: "
"it helps making sure that the dataset can be found, understood, and reused "
"by users. Interoperability metadata, when activated, are just as important: "
"they help making sure that other systems can understand the content of the "
"dataset."
