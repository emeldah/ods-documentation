"Before diving into which quotas exist on OpenDataSoft portals, it is "
"important to introduce the license topic. A license applies to each and "
"every OpenDataSoft portal. It is a contract between OpenDataSoft and the "
"portal owners, defining how much data can be injected into the portal and "
"the consumption of this data."

"Your license defines 4 global limits on your portal: the first one puts an "

"amount of data you can inject into the portal."

"The number of API calls measure can be a bit difficult to wrap his/her head "
"around since this is a very technical measure of the activity. But it can be"
" summarised as such: everytime somebody accesses your portal, for example "
"the datasets catalog page, the interface will make requests to the portal "
"for the filters values, for the 10 first datasets then the 10 next ones etc."
" Each of these requests is an API call and counted within the quota."

"Since your portal has global upper limits set, you want to avoid having "
"anybody use all of the license quota just by him/herself. You can therefore "
"set general limits on users and if your portal is open to anonymous users, "

"anonymous users to be sure that they won't eat up all of your usage quota."
