Adding assets
=============

When customizing your portal, you'll probably need static files (images, font files) to be available throughout the
platform. This page will enable you to do just that: upload files to your platform so that you can link to them in the
:ref:`stylesheet <theme__stylesheet>` or within your pages.

You can access this page through the link in the back-office navigation bar.

.. ifconfig:: language == 'en'

   .. image:: images/assets__interface--en.png

.. ifconfig:: language == 'fr'

   .. image:: images/assets__interface--fr.png

You will be able to upload files that do not exceed 500kB. If you need to host larger files, you will have to resort to
an external file-hosting service.
